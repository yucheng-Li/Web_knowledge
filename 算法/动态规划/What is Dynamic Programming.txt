How should I explain dynamic programming to a 4-year-old?
底下有个42K赞同的答案，是这样说的：

*writes down "1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 =" on a sheet of paper*

"What's that equal to?"

*counting* "Eight!"

*writes down another "1+" on the left*

"What about that?"

*quickly* "Nine!"

"How'd you know it was nine so fast?"

"You just added one more"

"So you didn't need to recount because you remembered there were eight!Dynamic Programming is just a fancy way to say 'remembering stuff to save time later'"

而且如果一个题目要求我们求问题的最优解，而且该问题能被分成若干个子问题，并且子问题之间还可能有重叠的更小子问题，
就可以考虑用动态规划来解决
